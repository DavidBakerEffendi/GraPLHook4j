A Java driver for the GraPL project to provide an interface for connecting and writing to various graph databases based
on the [code-property graph schema](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/codepropertygraph/blob/master/codepropertygraph/src/main/resources/schemas/base.json).

This CPG schema has been slightly adjusted to work with a graph database agnostic project. The models and enums can be
found under `za.ac.sun.grapl.domain`. The extensive documentation will be released with the first major release of the
GraPL project.

## Features

GraPL is currently under development. It has the following capabilities:
* Writes domain models to the graph database.
* Project an intraprocedural AST of a JVM program using JVM bytecode:
  - Package/Class/Method hierarchy
  - Variable assignments
  - Arithmetic
  - If-else bodies
* Can export an in-memory graph database to GraphML, GraphSON, and Gryo.

## Building from Source

In order to use GraPLHook4j one will need to build from the source code. This will be the case until the GraPL project 
can be hosted on a Maven repository or similar.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/DavidBakerEffendi/GraPLHook4j.git
cd GraPLHook4j
./gradlew jar # For main artifact only
./gradlew fatJar # For fat jar with dependencies
```
This will build `target/GraPLHook4j-X.X.X[-all].jar` which is imported into your local project. E.g.
```mxml
<dependency>
  <groupId>za.ac.sun.grapl</groupId>
  <artifactId>GraPLHook4j</artifactId>
  <version>X.X.X</version>
  <scope>system</scope>
  <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/GraPLHook4j-X.X.X.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
``` 
```groovy
repositories {
    // ...
    flatDir {
        dirs 'lib'
    }
}
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation name: 'GraPLHook4j-X.X.X'
}
```

## Dependencies

### Packages

The following packages used by GraPLHook4j are:

* `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.8.2`
* `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl:2.8.2`
* `org.apache.tinkerpop:gremlin-core:3.4.5`

Dependencies per graph database technology connected to:

* _TinkerGraph_ `org.apache.tinkerpop:tinkergraph-gremlin:3.4.5`
* _JanusGraph_ `org.janusgraph:janusgraph-driver:0.5.1`

It is not recommended using the fat jar in your project if using a build tool such as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. Rather,
use the main artifact and add the dependencies manually (in your `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc.). Note that if you are
connecting to Neo4j, for example, you would not need the TinkerGraph, TigerGraph, etc. dependencies. 

### Java Support

The officially supported versions of Java are the following:
* OpenJDK 8
* OpenJDK 9
* OpenJDK 10
* OpenJDK 11

### Graph Database Support

Databases supported:
* TinkerGraph
* JanusGraph (`exportGraph` currently not supported due to how JanusGraph Driver works)

Planned to support in the near future:
* TigerGraph
* Neo4j
* Amazon Neptune

## Basic Process

GraPLHook4j works through immutable domain objects, and a high level API in order to construct and analyse a
code-property graph. The notation used is from the [Java ASM5](https://asm.ow2.io/) library. Method signatures, arrays 
and types all follow this representation. An example of using the driver API is:
```java
import za.ac.sun.grapl.domain.enums.EvaluationStrategies;
import za.ac.sun.grapl.domain.models.vertices.BlockVertex;
import za.ac.sun.grapl.domain.models.vertices.FileVertex;
import za.ac.sun.grapl.domain.models.vertices.MethodVertex;
import za.ac.sun.grapl.domain.models.vertices.MethodReturnVertex;
import za.ac.sun.grapl.hooks.TinkerGraphHook;

public class GraPLDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int order = 0;
        int lineNumber = 1;
        TinkerGraphHook hook = new TinkerGraphHook.TinkerGraphHookBuilder("./GraPLHook4j_demo.xml")
                .createNewGraph(true)
                .build();
        FileVertex fileVertex = new FileVertex("GraPLTest", order++);
        MethodVertex methodVertex = new MethodVertex("add", "GraPLTest.add", "II", lineNumber, order++);
        // Since the associated file and method vertices aren't already in the database, they will automatically
        // be created in the following method:
        hook.joinFileVertexTo(fileVertex, methodVertex);
        hook.createAndAddToMethod(
                methodVertex,
                new MethodReturnVertex("VOID", "V", EvaluationStrategies.BY_VALUE, lineNumber, order++)
        );
        // ...
        // etc.
        hook.exportCurrentGraph();
    }

}
```
Given that this class is in this directory and GraPLHook4j has been packaged using the `./gradlew fatJar` command, we
can compile and execute this code using the following:
```shell script
javac -cp ".:build/libs/GraPLHook4j-x.x.x-all.jar:" GraPLDemo.java
java -cp ".:build/libs/GraPLHook4j-x.x.x-all.jar:" GraPLDemo 
```
This will export a file named `GraPLHook4j_demo.xml` which can be visualized using tools such as
[Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/). Using Cytoscape and the tree layout, the graph should look something like this:

![GraPLDemo.java Graph](https://github.com/DavidBakerEffendi/GraPLHook4j/blob/media/graphs/GraPLDemo.png?raw=true)

## Logging

All logging can be configured under `src/main/resources/log4j2.properties`. By default, all logs can be found under 
`/tmp/grapl`.
